# "Terraforming" Ultimate AWS Certified SA Associate 2020 course!

## Overview
This repository will cover the course [Ultimate AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate 2020](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/ "Aws course") and apply all its infrastructure resources via Terraform, see how it will be organized:
- It'll be splited by sections. The course has 27 sections and of course not all of them will be created as a folder inside this repo, and here's why: There are some sections which are focused on practical exams, architectural concepts which are not related to provisioning.
- Each section will have a main.tf file and a folder called module. Those are the responsible for provisioning all our infrastructure (i'll go deeper in the further steps)
